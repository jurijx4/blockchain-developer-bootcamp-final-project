# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
ConsenSys Academy final project 

I am still choosing between 3 final projects.
1. Land Registry
2. Grading system
3. DeFi Dashboard like Zapper or Instadapp

Land Registry:

All real rights on real estate are entered in the land register (eg property right, mortgage, land debt, easement right, encumbrance right, building right).Here in Slovenia we
have an very old centralized system for land registry.

Grading system:

I would like to implement an grading system where you can grade each other as a person. For an example there is a waiter that served you well and you would like to tip him. With
the tip you can pay for the transaction fees and rate the waiter for good service or even write a good comment about him/her.

DeFi Dashboard:

I would like to create an middleware that aggregates multiple DeFi protocols into one upgradable smart contract layer. For now i am leaning towards this project to be my final
project. Unfortunately i do not understand how broad and demanding this project will be.
